# QA-App
An application to view, add, edit and delete question and answers

Currently the user can:
- view the question and answer list
- add a new question and answer
- delete the complete list 
- sort the list
- edit or delete the individual QA

How-to:
- Install with npm install
- Run the application with **npm start**
- Test the application with **npm test** 
- Find the code coverage with **npm test:coverage**

Aim:
- My aim is to develop a reusable, readable and maintainable code.
- Framework: React + Typescript(typing always helps to catch the bugs at an earlier stage) + React Bootstrap
- State management: React.useContext 
- Testing :Jest(snapshots and userEvents)
- Linting:ESLint
- Code Formatter:Prettier
- Styling:CSS + bootstrap +custom CSS
